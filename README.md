## About
Ape Intelligence is vast evergrowing module library I use in my everyday workflow. Most of these modules are independant, however, some of them require more knowledge of specific use cases in order to understand them.
Everyone is free to take and use the source code of these modules as they like, I hope you enjoy.

## Usage
I've provided an rbxm file in the main directory. It is important you reparent/ungroup the contents in their respective services

---
<h3 align="center"> General usage is as follows </h3>

- Redefine the roblox global requrie
```lua
local require = require(game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage"):WaitForChild("ApeIntelligence"))
```
- Now you are able to requrie modules by name
```lua
local Maid = require("Maid")
```
 - Or by directly indexing it
 ```lua
 local Snackbar = require.Snackbar
 ```
and a few other methods provided in the link above

See [Here](https://github.com/Quenty/NevermoreEngine/blob/version2/loader/ReplicatedStorage/Nevermore/README.md)

Further documentation is located in the main ApeIntelligence module
